# Rcodes
This folder comrpises of various projects that I did during my summer internship at Indian Institute of management as well as the course work
for the Data analysis and Visualisation course at my university.
The .R files are the R codes and I am attaching them with the real time data set used. The interpreted results are mentioned in my reports 
and other documents that I have provided.
The first is the project on hotel pricing variations all over India and the trends that can be analysed with respect to the tourism sector 
of the countrys' as well as many other factors that influnce the hotel pricings. The MBA salaries and airline reports are created from Harvard
Business Review reports and were analysed accordingly with respect to the problem statement provided.
The anova analysis and regression were also performed on another example dataset given.(work during the course) The R code and the analysis
are provided together in the word document for the course work.
